# Testing the React Application:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Agenda:

We will discuss about how we can configure our app with testing libraries and detail description on how we should write the test the app.

## Why?

## Available Script

`npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

## Testing libraries.

The [@testing-library](https://www.npmjs.com/org/testing-library) family of packages helps you test UI components in a _user-centric_ way.

1. `React Testing Library` - RTL - It provides light utility functions on top of _react-dom_ and _react-dom/test-utils_
2. `Jest`, `Karma`, `Enzyme` etc - To write the better test cases.

## Libraries installed and its requirements:

1. `Jest` - a library helps to write the better and structured test cases, for [more details](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
2. `Babel-Jest` - used to transpile the ts|tsx|jsx to JS
3. `@types/jest` - provided the globals(describe, it, beforeEach etc)
